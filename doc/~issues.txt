   issue 20190329°0421 'impossible index'
   matter : The function is called with iNdx = 2, when only two canvases
      exist on the page. How can this be? Where from comes this call?
   workaround : As a quick-n-dirty remedy I just try a condition

   issue 20160416°1321 'IE8 canvas Context.fillText not supported'
   symptom : Text not drawn in IE8
   location : file 20140916°0411 canvasgersalgos.js "iko.Context.fillText(..)"
   ref : 20160419°1212 presents solutions

   ref : 20160419°1213 https://code.google.com/archive/p/canvas-text/
   ref : 20160419°1216 http://canvas-text.googlecode.com/svn-history/trunk/
   finding : I tested versions 20160419°121502 and 20160419°122102 of excanvas.js,
      and those did not work either. They just showed a differrent error in IE8.
   solution : Possibly use canvas-text.js (just this may be too expensive).
   status : open (and possibly will never be closed)

   issue 20150223°1851 'canvas inside paragraph'
   text : IE8 and probably higher, do not render a canvas inside
      a paragraph. (1) This is a drawback because until now, I usually placed
      icons and images inside paragraphs. Those images cannot simply be
      replaced by canvases. As a workaround, I placed the canvas inside
      a dedicated floating div (css div.iconFloatLeft rule 20150223°1841°.
      (2) And it is another drawback, because the Daftari page element
      editor does (so far) not equip the div element with edit icons.

   issue 20150223°1821 'canvas inside paragraph does not work with IE'
   location : File canvasgear.js for IE
   symptom : If embedding the canvas inside a <p> tag, IE9 will not show it.
   problem : A 'div' inside a 'p' like '<p><div></div></p>' is not valid HTML.
   see : ref 20150223°1831 'stackoverflow: div inside p is adding extra p'
   see : ref 20150223°1813 'Rakesh Pai: IE runtime error using innerHTML'
   workaround : Just wrap the canvas element plus it's command comment
      into a div. No! This destroys the paragraphs 'iconfloatleft' style!
   proposal : Perhaps a javascript preprocessor could find canvases directly
      inside a paragraph, and wrap them with a div element.
   status : Partially solved by workaround. Does work with IE10 but not IE9 and below.

   todo 20140904°0711 'refactor property parsing'
   todo : Refactor. Compact sequence 20140904°0645 to one-liners or
      somehow eliminate the individual processing of each single property.
      Or outsource above sequence to dedicated helper function. Or use
      a loop over all object properties instead individual properties.

   issue 20140901°0933 'Opera peculiar about capitals'
   note : If above e.g. 'iko.width' is used instead 'iko.Width', Opera will
      receive iPt1x/iPt1y as NaN and throw an exception here. If this line here
      throws exception, far below lines will do so as well.
   location : canvasgear.js, canvasgear-ballist.js
   solution : Use a try envelop on the first element. Questions are left open.

   issue 20140901°0911 'Opera fillRect() fail'
   title : Opera fillRect() fail
   location : canvasgear.js with Opera 10.53
   descr : in line "iko.Context.fillRect(0, 0, iko.Canvas.Width, iko.Canvas.Height);",
      Opera throws exception 'Error: NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR'.
   workaround : Wrap line in try envelope. Disadvantage is, that
      the background is no more filled with it's color.
   note : At other locations, fillRect() obviously works fine in Opera.
   finding 20140901°0921 : Opera seems being case sensitive with object
      properties e.g. wrong 'iko.Canvas.Width' vs. right 'iko.Canvas.width'!

   issue 20140901°0331 'IE8 demands extra plus sign'
   matter :  The plus sign before iko.Width and iko.Height is wanted for
       IE8, which will otherwise interpret that as string, and e.g.
       iSize will have the value 3232 if width=64 and height=64.
   location : e.g. line 20140916°0821
       "var iSize = (+iko.Width + +iko.Height) / 2;"
   status : IE8 is no more supported

   issue 20140831°0631 'IE8 fails drawing canvas'
   matter : Below this point (in references.html), in IE8 no more icons are drawn.
   note : This has directly to do with debug sequence 20140817°2321 in canvasgearexcanvas.js.
   note : Could not find out why.
   workaround : None yet
   status : Finished, IE8 is no more supported

   issue 20140830°0231 'IE webcolors'
   text : IE8 does not understand all webcolors. IE understands
      e.g 'blue' but not 'lightblue'.
   workaround : Use RGB values for all colors. Or implement a mapping function.

   issue 20140830°0221 'IE get HTML comment'
   summary : About reading a HTML comment from various browsers
   findings :
      (1) A comment node cannot be directly found.
      (2) It can be found in a node collection it's nodeType, which is 8.
      (3) Having that node, IE and the others differ
      (3.1) In IE, the comment can be read via n.innerHTML or n.nodeValue.
      (3.2) In others, n.innerHTML yields 'undefined'.
      (3.3) In others, the comment can be read via n.nodeValue.
   location : File canvasgear.js seq 20140830°0211
   note : After sequence 20140830°0311, it looks as if the both browsers
      understand nodeValue. Possibly, this issue was just a misconception?
   status : Finished

   issue 20140829°0331 'Color and stroke select on canvas'.
   matter : When drawing on a canvas, a line is started with beginPath,
      the color and the stroke can be set. On one canvas, only one style
      seems possible, but more styles are wanted.
   ref : Screenshot 20140829°0322. Note icons one and **two**. It tries
          to draw two objects, a triangle and a line. It has only one color
          and stroke, not different, as should. How to write code to put two
          objects on one canvas?
   todo : Clear whether this is just a coding particularity, or whether
       a canvas can indeed display only one color and stroke. Perhaps
       it has to do with layers or the like. [todo 20140829°0315]
   status : Probably finished

   issue 20140828°1151 'IE8 canvas innerHTML unusable'
   matter : With IE8, the canvas property 'innerHTML' is unusable. With workaround
      func 20140828°1231 findComments1 or func 20140828°1241 findComments2 applied,
      IE8 may display the dialog as in screenshot 20140828°1321.
   solution : See sequence/function 20140830°0311.
   location : File canvasgear.js seq 20140830°0211
   workaround : Use something else to store the icon command, e.g.
       a comment like in seq 20140828°1251 (discarded 20140830°0246)
   note : Workaround was not useful, makes IE freeze see screenshot 20140828°1321

   issue 20140828°0751 'algo calling params quirk'
   title : Algo calling params quirk
   symptom : When calling the outsourced algorithm with the plain Ikon object
      as parameter, only the first canvas is drawn, the other are skipped.
   suspect : Parameter passing is not consequently done by reference.
   workaround : Call it with the full Ikon objects array plus the index.
   note : About failed attempts to pass the plain icon

      - // icos[iFor] = algoPulse(x);
