   howto 20190331°0541 'about linebreaks in canvas'
   matter : The canvas method fillText does not support linebreaks.
      You have to do it on your own. There exist several solutions.

   feature 20190331°0411 'riders also in subfolder'

      canvasgear.js, I want an alternative place, the subfolder 'riders'

   feature 20190330°0141 'external algo overwrites built-in one'
   matter : The Template algo exists in two flavours, the built-in and the
      external one. If the both are present, means if file canvasgear.Template.js
      is copied parallel to canvasgear.js, the code of the external file shall
      be executed, not that of the built-in Template algo of canvasgear.js.
      But if no canvasgear.Template.js exists, the built-in code shall work.
   note : To make this work in general, we had to make the pull-behind test
      for each algo existing on the page. This can become pretty expensive.
      So best we suffice with this mechanism restriced to the Template algo.
   status : Works for Template algo, but not others.

   note 20140815°0731
   matter : Coming from the example after (20140814°2211)
      http://www.kirupa.com/html5/creating_simple_html5_canvas_animation.htm,
      I want the following features to be changed:
       - The JS code is inside the HTML, I want it as a separate JS file
       - It is for modern browsers only, I want it for older browsers as well.
   finding : The transition did not succeed on the first attempt. So I introduced
      the file series canvas-2-pulse-v*.html to introduces the wanted features
      step by step. The steps are:
       - v1 : Pretty the original as is.
       - v2 : Introcude excanvas.js
       - v3 : Split file into HTML and JS
       - v4 : ...
