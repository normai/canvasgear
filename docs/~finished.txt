   issue 20190402°0611 'audio data source does not work'
   matter : Audio data source does not work with Howler.

   todo 20190401°1553 'finetune sound installation'
   matter : In reference script 'A Noisy Page', the sound installation
      allows controling the volume, but is a bit tricky. It did not work
      for us on the first attempt. Thus we retreted to the bare bone
      instructions from SoundManager2, which are obviously simpler.
   do : Try abain to implement the sound solution as done in 'A Noisy Page'.
   see : ref 20190401°0541 'Scott Schiller → A noisy page (animation.js)'

   note 20190401°0441 'about rotation center point'
   text : The MDN documentation says: The rotation center point is always
      the canvas origin. To change the center point, you will need to
      move the canvas by using the translate() method.
   bottomline: Looks like we need to wrap the rotate in two translate.

   todo 20190330°0423 'catch callback stockpile array overflow'
   matter : The brute force solution of issue 20190330°0355 'callback parameters
      useless' involves a hardcoded array with callbacks. This will come short
      if a page has many external or wrong algorithms.
   do : Implement detecting and processing the possible over-use of this array.
        It suffices, if the affected icons just do not get their wanted external
        algo, but fall back to the default algoritm.
   status : finished [20190402°0354]
   ܀

   issue 20190330°0331 'pull-behind only per algo'
   matter : Do the pull-behind only once for one algo, even if that algo appears
      multiple times on the page. Otherwise curious script abortion observed.
   note : This was seen on page 20190324°0511 demo2.html
   status : finished
   ܀

   todo 20190329°1045 'commandline and default values'
   text : The commandline should be evaluated only after the algorithm is
      known, and the algo default properties are assigned. This makes a clear
      cascaded order, where just each later value overwrite the earlier one.
   finding : It may be not soo simple, because at least the algorithm name
      must have been read already from the commandline, before the others
      values can be processed. And only if the algo name is know, possibly
      a pull-behind with unclear result happens.
   finding : The bulk commandline interpretation should ideally happen
      after the pull-behind process has settled.

   issue 20190329°0421 'impossible index'
   matter : The function is called with iNdx = 2, when only two canvases
      exist on the page. How can this be? Where from comes this call?
   workaround : As a quick-n-dirty remedy I just try a condition

   issue 20160416°1321 'IE8 canvas Context.fillText not supported'
   symptom : Text not drawn in IE8

   ref : 20160419°1216 http://canvas-text.googlecode.com/svn-history/trunk/
   finding : I tested versions 20160419°121502 and 20160419°122102 of excanvas.js,
      and those did not work either. They just showed a differrent error in IE8.
   solution : Possibly use canvas-text.js (just this may be too expensive).

   todo : Refactor. Compact sequence 20140904°0645 to one-liners or
      somehow eliminate the individual processing of each single property.
      Or outsource above sequence to dedicated helper function. Or use
      a loop over all object properties instead individual properties.

   issue 20140901°0933 'Opera 10 peculiar about capitals'
   note : If e.g. 'iko.width' was used instead 'iko.Width', Opera will
      receive iPt1x/iPt1y as NaN and throw an exception here. If this
      line here throws exception, far below lines will do so as well.
   location : canvasgear.js, canvasgear-ballist.js
   solution : Use a try envelop on the first element.
   status : Should be finished.

   title : Opera fillRect() fail
   location : canvasgear.js with Opera 10.53
   descr : in line "iko.Context.fillRect(0, 0, iko.Canvas.Width, iko.Canvas.Height);",
      Opera throws exception 'Error: NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR'.
   workaround : Wrap line in try envelope. Disadvantage is, that
      the background is no more filled with it's color.
   note : At other locations, fillRect() obviously works fine in Opera.
   finding 20140901°0921 : Opera seems being case sensitive with object
      properties e.g. wrong 'iko.Canvas.Width' vs. right 'iko.Canvas.width'!

   todo 20140901°0611 ''
   matter : JavaScript advanced programming. Currently, different algorithms
      are called via a switch, depending on the given token from the commandline.
   do : Make the algorithm function a property of the icon, so it can
         directly be called without any switch.
   status : finished (by introducing rider scripts 20190330°0757)
   ܀

   issue 20140901°0331 'IE8 demands extra plus sign'
   matter :  The plus sign before iko.Width and iko.Height is wanted for
       IE8, which will otherwise interpret that as string, and e.g.
       iSize will have the value 3232 if width=64 and height=64.

   issue 20140831°0631 'IE8 fails drawing canvas'
   matter : Below this point (in page 20140902°1311 attic.html), IE8 draws no more icons.
   note : This has directly to do with debug sequence 20140817°2321 in canvasgearexcanvas.js.
   note : Could not find out why.
   workaround : None yet

   issue 20140830°0231 'IE webcolors'
   text : IE8 does not understand all webcolors. IE understands
      e.g 'blue' but not 'lightblue'.
   workaround : Use RGB values for all colors. Or implement a mapping function.

   issue 20140830°0221 'IE get HTML comment'
   summary : About reading a HTML comment from various browsers
   findings :
      (1) A comment node cannot be directly found.
      (2) It can be found in a node collection it's nodeType, which is 8.
      (3) Having that node, IE and the others differ
      (3.1) In IE, the comment can be read via n.innerHTML or n.nodeValue.
      (3.2) In others, n.innerHTML yields 'undefined'.
      (3.3) In others, the comment can be read via n.nodeValue.
   location : File canvasgear.js seq 20140830°0211
   note : After sequence 20140830°0311, it looks as if the both browsers
      understand nodeValue. Possibly, this issue was just a misconception?
   status : Finished

   issue 20140829°0331 'Color and stroke select on canvas'.
   matter : When drawing on a canvas, a line is started with beginPath,
      the color and the stroke can be set. On one canvas, only one style
      seems possible, but more styles are wanted.
   ref : Screenshot 20140829°0322. Note icons one and **two**. It tries
          to draw two objects, a triangle and a line. It has only one color
          and stroke, not different, as should. How to write code to put two
          objects on one canvas?
   todo : Clear whether this is just a coding particularity, or whether
       a canvas can indeed display only one color and stroke. Perhaps
       it has to do with layers or the like. [todo 20140829°0315]
   status : Probably finished

   issue 20140828°1151 'IE8 canvas innerHTML unusable'
   matter : With IE8, the canvas property 'innerHTML' is unusable. With workaround
      func 20140828°1231 findComments1 or func 20140828°1241 findComments2 applied,
      IE8 may display the dialog as in screenshot 20140828°1321.
   solution : See sequence/function 20140830°0311.
   location : File canvasgear.js seq 20140830°0211
   workaround : Use something else to store the icon command, e.g.
       a comment like in seq 20140828°1251 (discarded 20140830°0246)
   note : Workaround was not useful, makes IE freeze see screenshot 20140828°1321

   issue 20140828°0751 'algo calling params quirk'
   title : Algo calling params quirk
   symptom : When calling the outsourced algorithm with the plain Ikon object
      as parameter, only the first canvas is drawn, the other are skipped.
   suspect : Parameter passing is not consequently done by reference.
   workaround : Call it with the full Ikon objects array plus the index.
   note : About failed attempts to pass the plain icon
      - // var x = icos[iFor];
      - // icos[iFor] = algoPulse(x);
      - // algoPulse(icos[iFor]);

   issue 20140828°0541 'IE8 is drawing outside the canvas'
   matter : If painting outside the canvas, two different behaviours result:
      (1) IE8: The object is painted even outside the canvas borders. This is what IE does.
      (2) Chrome, FF, Opera: The object outside the canvas borders is clipped.
   note : One question is, whether for the outborder parts, the calculations are done
      or skipped. The answer were interesting for resource and performance understanding.
   ref : Screenshots see ..
   status : finished

   todo 20140815°1141
